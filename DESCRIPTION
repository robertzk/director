Package: director
Title: Load, track, and manage dependencies in a file structure.
Description: Director is responsible for managing and loading resources in
    some fixed directory structure. It has support for tracking changes between
    consecutive loads of resources (so that we can tell if a script was modified
    since we last ran it) and defining parsers that allow us to generalize from
    the pernicious simple linear execution that is common to R.
