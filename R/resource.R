#' Fetch a resource relative to a director object.
#'
#' Resources are R scripts that optionally have a "parser" attached
#' which takes the result of executing the file, including all of its local
#' variables, and does some additional computation. This is useful if,
#' for example, you are trying to define a standard format for creating a
#' reference class object by specifying some inputs, but want to make it
#' easy to provide those inputs by users.
#' 
#' This method will return a list containing four keys, `current`, `cached`,
#' `value`, and `modified` if it finds the given resource, or error
#' if no such resource exists. The former two keys, `current` and `cached`,
#' will contain information relating to the current and previous execution
#' of this resource, while `value` contains a function that will execute the
#' file and return its output, and `modified` is a logical flag indicating
#' whether or not the file has been modified since it was last executed by
#' the director.
#'
#' @param name character. The name of the resource (i.e. R script) relative
#'   to the root of the director object.
#' @param provides list or environment. A list or environment of values to provide
#'   to the resource. The default is nothing, i.e., \code{list()}. Note that
#'   \code{provides} will be coerced to an environment, and its parent 
#'   environment will be set to \code{parent.env(topenv())} to prevent
#'   access to global variables (and encourage modularity and lack of side
#'   effects. There should always be a way to write your code without them).
#' @param body logical. Whether or not the fetch the body of the resource
#'   in the `current` and `cached` output lists.
#' @param soft logical. Whether or not to modify the cache to reflect
#'   the resource modification time and other details.
#' @param ... additional arguments to pass to the \code{base::source}
#'   function that gets executed when the `value` is accessed.
#' @param tracking logical. Whether or not to perform modification tracking
#'   by pushing accessed resources to the director's stack.
#' @param check.helpers logical. If \code{TRUE}, the resource's helpers
#'   (assuming it is an idempotent resource -- that is, a resource whose
#'   parent directory has the same name as the resource). The default is
#'   \code{TRUE}. If \code{FALSE}, the \code{name} parameter will not be
#'   converted into a resource name.
#' @return a four-element list with names `current`, `cached`, `value`,
#'   and `modified`. The former two will both be two-element lists containing
#'   keys `info` and `body` (unless director has never executed the resource before
#'   in which case the latter will be \code{NULL}). The `info` key holds the
#'   result of calling R's built-in \code{file.info} on the resource (and includes
#'   information like created at and modified at time), whereas the `body`
#'   key holds a character representation of the body of the resource (useful
#'   for comparing if any actual modifications have been made).
#'
#'   The `value` key in the returned list holds a function which will
#'   execute the given resource in the \code{provides} environment. A function
#'   is returned instead of the actual value to let the caller control
#'   whether or not the resource is executed (e.g., based on its properties
#'   in the `current` list). Most frequently, this means consulting the
#'   `modified` key of the returned list, which will hold a logical
#'   indicating whether or not the resource has been modified since last
#'   executed by the director (if this was never the case, `modified` will
#'   be \code{FALSE}).
